# History

"ReconOS has been actively developed since its inception in 2006. Since then it has gone through three major revisions and has been ported to several operating systems and hardware platforms.

## Version 1

ReconOS v. 1.0 used the eCos operating system running on PowerPC CPUs embedded in Xilinx Virtex-2 Pro and Virtex-4 FPGAs.

## Version 2

ReconOS v. 2.0 improved on the original version by providing FIFO interconnects between hardware threads, adding support for the Linux operating system, and offering a common virtual address space between hardware and software threads.

## Version 3

ReconOS v. 3.0, which was released in early 2013, is a major overhaul that streamlines the hardware architecture towards a more lightweight and modular design. It brings ReconOS to the Microblaze/Linux and Microblaze/Xilkernel architectures and has been used extensively on Virtex-6 FPGAs and the Xilinx Zynq platform."
