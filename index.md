> "The ReconOS operating system for reconfigurable computing offers a unified
> multithreaded programming model and OS services for threads executing in
> software and threads mapped to reconfigurable hardware. By semantically
> integrating hardware accelerators into a standard OS environment,
> ReconOS allows for rapid design-space exploration, supports a structured
> application development process, and improves the portability of applications
> between different reconfigurable computing systems."
